# rnd195.github.io

This repository contains the source code for my personal website <https://rnd195.github.io/> hosted on GitHub Pages. It's built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a little bit of [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/). I took inspiration from these wonderful personal webpages that were also built using Quarto: [samanthacsik.github.io](https://samanthacsik.github.io/), [mickael.canouil.fr](https://mickael.canouil.fr/), and [hadley.nz](https://hadley.nz/).

The website is built by running the `RENDER.ps1` script, which outputs files into the `docs/` folder. This directory is then deployed by GitHub Pages and served at <https://rnd195.github.io/>.
