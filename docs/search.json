    "text": "About the event and my takeaways\nFOSDEM1 is the largest conference about free and open source software.2 This year’s event was held for the 25th time in the first two days of February, and I was fortunate enough to be attending. It was my first time participating in the event, and what I was initially struck by (in a positive way) was the conference’s turnout. In fact, so many people showed up to the event that, on several occasions throughout the first day, my connection to the cellular network had trouble keeping up.\nAmong other things, the event consisted of talks/lectures/panels on topics such as Android, Python, Security, and 70+ other tracks.3 I overheard some people describing the event as chaotic and while I get that the sheer size of the conference could give this impression, I feel like calling it “chaotic” takes away from the impressive level of planning and organization demonstrated by the team behind the conference. For instance, each talk was streamed live and recorded, every block that I attended was on schedule, the event even had companion apps, and so much more.\nThe topics that I was mainly interested in were centered around data science, Python, as well as legal & policy. I particularly enjoyed the panel discussion on what it means for an AI system or a machine learning model to be free/open.4 It was also great to meet some of the people behind the PyArrow5 package—I typically use PyArrow for data storage via the .parquet file format, and while this is only a small portion of the package’s capabilities, I consider it to be such a time (& disk space) saver. Last but not least, I attended a talk about commercially viable companies that focus on developing open source software and what it takes to be respected by the open source community.6"

The gentleman said that there is no wrong way to experience the event, and it’s really up to each attendee to make the most out of it.\nFrom my experience, it’s best to be prepared for the highly likely possibility that you won’t be able to visit all the talks that you planned to visit due to time and room capacity constraints. Therefore, I would suggest choosing a few developer rooms that you can retreat to if things don’t go according to the plan. Each talk is live-streamed and recorded (available a week or so after the event), so I wouldn’t really worry about missing a particular talk. I think that the added value of this event is that it is in-person. I would instead focus on that.\nFor more tips and insights about the event in general, allow me to recommend this detailed write-up on the ./techtipsy blog about last year’s event.\n Comment on GitHub"

    "section": "",
    "text": "An interactive visualization of two-dimensional matrix-vector multiplication using the bokeh library.\nIn my attempt at understanding matrix multiplication more intuitively, I stumbled upon a 2011 post on the Stata blog by William Gould.1 In this article, Gould illustrates how matrices transform space. Specifically, the author lays out a series of images visualizing what happens when we multiply a 2 by 2 matrix by a 2 by 1 vector.\nIn this blog post, you’ll find an interactive visualization written in Python using the bokeh library2 that demonstrates this very issue. But to get the full picture (no pun intended), I highly recommend reading Gould’s comprehensive and well-paced explanation of the whole setup first.3 That being said, to get the most out of the interactive demo that you’re going to see later in this blog post, consider this:\nFor example, the multiplication below:\n(2.6−0.9−1.1−2.2)(100)=(26−11)\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2.6 & -0.9\\\\\n-1.1 & -2.2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n10\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n26\\\\\n-11\n\\end{pmatrix}\ncan be drawn as a point going from x=10 y=0 (*) to x=26 y=-11 (**). In turn, the 2 by 2 matrix can be thought of as a set of instructions on how to move the point.\nNow imagine that you’re not looking at a single point, you’re looking at a whole bunch of points all being transformed by the same matrix. What would you see? This is what Gould shows in the fifth figure of the blog post, and it’s what inspired me to create this demo in bokeh. Take a look!\nThe added benefit of this interactive approach is that you can try out different values in the 2 by 2 matrix to see what happens. I like to imagine the purple field of points as some kind of a stretchy piece of paper, where each slider (i.e., each element of the 2 by 2 matrix) stretches the paper in a different direction, with 2 corners of the paper always pinned down. In addition, the bottom-row sliders appear to warp the paper up and down while the top-row sliders stretch it left and right.\nIn fact, a similar space-bending effect can be seen in 3Blue1Brown’s videos on linear algebra4 5 or part of ChanRT’s Visualize It project on GitHub.6 By illustrating this transformation using grid lines, 3Blue1Brown stresses that the key property of this act of “smooshing around space” is that the grid lines are spaced out evenly and stay parallel even after the transformation takes place.\nAs a visual learner, I found this approach quite helpful in better understanding the intuition behind matrix multiplication. I hope it’s been beneficial to you as well. For those of you interested in how this relates to linear regression, consider finishing Gould’s original post on the Stata blog.7"

While it’s great to get feedback from others when sharing your code, there may be simple reasons why that’s not always possible. For instance, if you’re building an internal package at work or testing something out, it’s usually not for sharing."

    "text": "Get started\nFirst, let’s start by installing uv on your machine. Assuming you have Python version 3.8 or later installed, an easy way to install uv is to use pip. You can add it to your user environment by running\npip install uv --user\nin your terminal. Make sure that the local user Python scripts folder (on Windows, typically: %APPDATA%\\Python\\&lt;Python version&gt;\\Scripts) is in your PATH environment variable. You can also install uv directly (see docs), which should work without making additional changes.\nOnce uv is installed (v0.8.4 used), initialize your project by running:\nuv init\nNow, the directory of your project should look like this:\nmy-internal-pkg/\n├── .gitignore\n├── .python-version\n├── main.py\n├── pyproject.toml\n└── README.md\nAs we can see, uv init created 5 files and initialized a git repository in the project folder. The important file to focus on is pyproject.toml. This file configures your future package based on what you specify inside. Let’s take a peek at the default structure of this file:\n[project]\nname = \"my-internal-pkg\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\ndescription = \"Add your description here\"\nreadme = \"README.md\"\nrequires-python = \"&gt;=3.12\"\ndependencies = []\nMost of the settings in your pyproject.toml are generated and managed by uv. Of course, all settings in this text file can be modified manually. Let’s leave these settings unchanged for now."

If you’re unfamiliar with polars, consider reading my guide on getting started with polars as a pandas user.\nFirst, let me install polars and set it as a dependency for my package:\nuv add polars\nThis command installs the package in a virtual environment (.venv folder) and modifies pyproject.toml by adding polars as a dependency. If we take a look at the pyproject.toml file now, the dependencies setting should look something like this\ndependencies = [\n    \"polars&gt;=1.31.0\",\n]\nNext, let me delete the main.py file since it’s not needed. I’ll then create a folder inside the root directory of my project and name it my_internal_pkg. I’ll also place an empty __init__.py file inside the newly created folder.\nMy goal is to write a function that calculates rolling min and max values—I’m going to place this function in df_helpers.py. Here’s the updated file tree:\nmy-internal-pkg/\n├── .venv/\n├── my_internal_pkg/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── df_helpers.py\n├── .gitignore\n├── .python-version\n├── pyproject.toml\n└── README.md\nNow onto the contents of df_helpers.py. Keeping it really simple, below is the rolling min max function I placed in this Python script:\nimport polars as pl\n\n\ndef rolling_min_max(df: pl.DataFrame, col: str, window: int = 3) -&gt; pl.DataFrame:\n    \"\"\"Get rolling min and max values of a specific column\"\"\"\n    return df.with_columns(\n        pl.col(col).rolling_min(window_size=window).alias(f\"{col}_roll_min\"),\n        pl.col(col).rolling_max(window_size=window).alias(f\"{col}_roll_max\")\n    )\nNow that we have something to be packaged, we’re almost set.

    "text": "Finalizing pyprojects.toml\nSince this tutorial is aimed at building a package locally, consider adding classifiers = [\"Private :: Do Not Upload\"] into the [project] section in the config file:\n[project]\nname = \"my-internal-pkg\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\ndescription = \"Add your description here\"\nreadme = \"README.md\"\nrequires-python = \"&gt;=3.12\"\ndependencies = [\n    \"polars&gt;=1.31.0\",\n]\nclassifiers = [\"Private :: Do Not Upload\"]\nThis labels the package as “private” and adds another layer of defense against accidentally publishing your package to PyPI (see docs).\nNext, let’s set up the [build-system] section. uv’s own backend has recently been marked as stable, and it seems reasonable to believe that it’s going to become the default in the future. In the meantime, let me use hatchling from the Python Packaging Authority, which uv authors considered reasonable as a build backend. As a sidenote, I was curious which prominent projects also use this build system: JupyterLab, for example.\nTo use hatchling as the build backend, we need to place the following section into the .toml file\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"hatchling &gt;= 1.26\"]\nbuild-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\nAdditionally, we have to specify the folder containing the core of our package (my_internal_pkg/ in our case) because the build system expects to find the src/ folder by default. Many prominent projects like django or pandas don’t follow these defaults either and instead place their scripts into django and pandas subfolders, respectively.\nConsequently, we also need to add 1 more section to pyproject.toml:\n[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]\npackages = [\"my_internal_pkg/\"]\nFor additional configuration like excluding files/folders in the source distribution, consider taking a look at hatch docs.\nWe’re almost at the finish line. For completeness, the final pyproject.toml file looks like this:\n[project]\nname = \"my-internal-pkg\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\ndescription = \"Add your description here\"\nreadme = \"README.md\"\nrequires-python = \"&gt;=3.12\"\ndependencies = [\n    \"polars&gt;=1.31.0\",\n]\nclassifiers = [\"Private :: Do Not Upload\"]\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"hatchling &gt;= 1.26\"]\nbuild-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\n\n[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]\npackages = [\"my_internal_pkg/\"]"

Inside this folder, we’re going to see our package in a .tar.gz (source distribution) and .whl (wheel) format. While the difference between these is beyond the scope of this post, if you’re going to be distributing your package locally—to other colleagues or your other systems—consider using the .whl file because it simplifies the process of installing the package. Note that both of these are ultimately archives, so you can take a look inside each to see the differences. To learn more about this topic, I would recommend reading this excellent article on Real Python.\nEnough stalling, let’s build the package. Open up a terminal in the root directory of the project, and simply type:\nuv build\nIf successful, the dist/ folder should pop up and the two distributions should be inside:\ndist/\n├── .gitignore\n├── my_internal_pkg-0.1.0.tar.gz\n└── my_internal_pkg-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl"

    "text": "This guide will help you start learning polars by showcasing analogous code snippets from pandas.\nIn recent years, polars1 is becoming increasingly popular in the data science community (more than 33k stars on GitHub as of May 20252). According to the author of polars, Ritchie Vink, the package’s API is “consistent and strict,” and its focus is on maximizing single machine performance3 which perhaps explains some of the library’s appeal. From my experience, polars has been a major time saver, especially in data-intensive computations. However, I think that it is perfectly reasonable to prefer pandas for some tasks (like quick data visualization), and I am glad that this competition is pushing the field forward.\nIn this post, I wrote down some of the most common operations in pandas and their equivalents in polars to help you get acquainted with the package (and to help myself remember). Please, note that this guide / cheat sheet may not be exhaustive and in some cases, there might be additional ways to achieve the same goal.

    "text": "Generating forecasts of Finnish electricity consumption using the TimesFM 200M model by Google Research\nIn early 2024, Google Research announced TimesFM, a pre-trained univariate time-series foundation model for time-series forecasting.1 First, let me break down the terminology. The general idea is that this is a model for sequences of data that are ordered in time (time-series). A few examples of time-series include: annual inflation rate, monthly precipitation, weekly water demand, or hourly temperatures. This being a forecasting model simply means that we are interested in predicting the future. Univariate implies that this model only takes in and outputs a single time-series—in other words, no other variables are utilized. Pre-trained means, for our purposes, that we don’t need to run the complex process of training the model. We simply download a large file that contains all the 200M parameters for the model to produce forecasts. Finally, a foundation model is one that has been pre-trained on a large number of diverse datasets.2\nTo be honest, when I first read about this model, I realized that I have never used a pre-trained time-series model. And it’s not like these didn’t exist before. In fact, several pre-trained foundation models have been released (see, for example3). But seeing Google Research announce their pre-trained time-series forecasting model put this whole category of models on my radar.\nIn their paper on TimesFM,4 the authors tested the model’s performance on popular time-series datasets and demonstrated that TimesFM was, in the majority of cases, able to outperform both classical and deep learning models using their methodology. For this reason, I was interested in knowing how well it would forecast something I am familiar with—electricity consumption."

    "text": "Data\nSpecifically, I decided to use electricity consumption data from the operator of the Finnish grid through their Open Data portal.5 At this point, I believe that it is important to give my words of appreciation to the people at Fingrid for providing easy access to the data with clear license terms. In my view, this is the way open data should be done, so thank you!\nFrom my experience, electricity consumption in (most of?) Europe typically follows these three major seasonal patterns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Simplified electricity consumption pattern in (most of?) Europe\n\n\n\nFirstly, there’s typically high electricity consumption in winter, lowering in spring, low during summer months, and slowly climbing upward in autumn. Note that the dip at the end of the year is due to winter holidays and it can be quite substantial. Secondly, on a typical work week, the Monday to Friday pattern looks fairly similar, but there is lower electricity consumption during the weekend. Finally, if we look at a single day’s worth of electricity consumption data, there will likely be less electricity consumed at night and consumption will peak around midday, perhaps in the afternoon, or early evening.\nIf we look at hourly electricity consumption in Finland (resampled from 15-min by averaging), I can cherry-pick specific weeks or days to make the series look similar to the patterns illustrated above. However, the full 2024 snapshot makes it clear that electricity consumption patterns in Finland are more nuanced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Hourly electricity consumption in Finland (MWh), 2024"

    "section": "Setup",
    "text": "Setup\nI will be benchmarking the 200M parameter model on the whole 2024 hourly consumption data illustrated above. Naturally, we already know what the 2024 electricity consumption looks like, but it would be highly impractical to produce forecasts from the current point in time onward while waiting for the future to materialize to collect the data and determine the accuracy of our predictions. Instead, we can go step by step, limiting the knowledge our forecasting model takes in, generate forecasts at that point in time, and immediately compare against the actual values. This is called pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting (see, for example6).\nIn electricity consumption forecasting, it often makes sense to think about the data in full days, not just individual hours. Therefore, I will be forecasting up to 24 hours ahead following the scheme described below:\n\nStart on Jan 1st 2024, 00:00 – this will be the first prediction\nWith no knowledge of electricity consumption on Jan 1st, produce forecasts up to 23:00 (included)\nSave these forecasts and move by one day\nGenerate predictions for Jan 2nd (00:00, 01:00, …, 23:00)\nMove by one day\nContinue until you reach Dec 31st 2024\n\nBelow is an illustration of the scheme—the three vertical lines are the starting points for each 24-hour prediction as well as a knowledge-cutoff line. The dashed curves illustrate predictions while the solid line is meant to represent actual values that are not “seen” by the model beforehand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Forecasting scheme illustration\n\n\n\nTo produce the forecasts, I am using the official timesfm Python package and the package-specific code only really takes a few lines if we leave all other hyperparameters set to their default values.\n# Up to 24 hours ahead\nhorizon = 24\n# Define model parameters\nmodel_params = timesfm.TimesFmHparams(\n    backend=\"gpu\",\n    horizon_len=horizon\n)\n# Load checkpoint from huggingface\nhf_checkpoint = timesfm.TimesFmCheckpoint(\n    huggingface_repo_id=\"google/timesfm-1.0-200m-pytorch\"\n)\n# Setup the model\nmodel = timesfm.TimesFm(\n    hparams=model_params,\n    checkpoint=hf_checkpoint\n)\nAssuming that our data is stored in a pandas DataFrame, we can produce forecasts by running\nfcst = model.forecast_on_df(\n    # Formatted dataframe\n    inputs=df,\n    # Data frequency (hourly)\n    freq=\"h\",\n    # Target variable column name\n    value_name=\"consumption\",\n    # -1 sets the number of processes to cpu count\n    num_jobs=-1\n)\nAnd that’s about it.

However, it seems to struggle with the shape of the peak hours (midday/afternoon) for most days of the week. Of course, this is just a single week out of the whole year, but these symptoms appear to be prevalent in most weeks of the year as suggested by the monthly error metrics displayed later (Figure 7 and Figure 8).\nBelow is a snapshot of early July 2024 forecasts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Forecasts vs actual values (first week of Jul 2024)\n\n\n\nThis is a totally different story as it seems that the model was capable of generating relatively accurate forecasts. This can likely be attributed to the less volatile pattern of electricity consumption in the summer months of 2024 which is certainly helpful for univariate models.\nFinally, let’s take a look at a sample from October 2024:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Forecasts vs actual values (first week of Oct 2024)\n\n\n\nIn this case, we get similar issues with the shape and sometimes even the level as in the first displayed plot. Interestingly, perhaps due to the autoregressive nature of the model, it was able to capture the distinct “U” shape of the peak consumption.\n\n\nError metrics\nUsing the forecasting scheme outlined above, the 200M TimesFM model with default parameters was capable of recording the following accuracy metrics on the 2024 Finnish electricity consumption data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric (total)\nValue\nExplainer\n\n\n\n\nMean absolute percentage error (MAPE)\n2.659%\nOn average, how much does a single point forecast deviate from actual values in absolute terms. Denoted in %\n\n\nRoot mean square error (RMSE)\n356.89071 MWh\nOn average, how much does a single point forecast deviate from actual values in squared terms. Larger mistakes are penalized more. Denoted in MWh\n\n\nR-squared\n95.817%\nThis can help determine shape accuracy, but not level\n\n\nMean bias error\n18.25352 MWh\nOverestimation (+) or underestimation (-), on average\n\n\n\nLet’s also take a look at MAPE and RMSE grouped by month to get a better picture of which months were easier to forecast with the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Monthly MAPE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Monthly RMSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear that the 200M TimesFM model was the most accurate in July and August which can partly be seen in Figure 5 as discussed earlier. In terms of RMSE, the least accurate forecasts were generated in the first month of 2024."

    "text": "Thoughts\nWhile I cannot confidently comment on the relative levels of these error metrics with respect to Finnish data due to a lack of experience with Finnish electricity consumption, I find these results impressive for a univariate model that doesn’t need to be trained. It is without a doubt that multivariate models would outperform this framework in this particular forecasting exercise. Still, I think it is valuable to benchmark the model on data that is known to be forecastable as it may help us understand what we can expect from the framework in other domains.\nRegardless, I am now very interested in future foundation time-series models that Google Research may release. Perhaps this is a sign of what’s to come in the time-series forecasting domain? I hope so. On that note, the TimesFM repository on GitHub has recently been updated with a 500M variant. Would this model generate more accurate forecasts in the exercise outlined in this post? It’s possible but that is a question for another time.\n Comment on GitHub Notebook with code"
